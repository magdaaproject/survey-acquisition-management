# MaGDAA - Survey Acquisition Management #

The [Mass Gathering Data Acquisition and Analysis][magdaa] project, MaGDAA for short, is a collaboration between the [Flinders University Disaster Research Centre][fudrc] and [The Serval Project][sp] at [Flinders University][fusa] in South Australia.

The focus of the project is on the development of an [Android][android] based platform that can be used to acquire and analyse data at a mass gathering event. For example at a music festival, Schoolies Week, or any other event where a crowd has gathered.

The purpose of the Survey Acquisition Management (SAM) software is designed to:

1. Make it easy for the researcher to select a survey from a list
2. Automatically launch the survey in the [ODK Collect][odk] application
3. Create a bundle of a finalised survey form and share on the mesh network

More information about the software is available in the [MaGDAA wiki][wiki]
